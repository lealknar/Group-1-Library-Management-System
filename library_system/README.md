Bataan Heroes College Library System is a web-based project that helps manage books, borrowers, and library transactions.  
It was created by our team to practice collaboration and apply what weâ€™ve learned in software development.  

Each member of the group worked on different parts of the system, including the frontend, backend, database, Backend, and QA.
