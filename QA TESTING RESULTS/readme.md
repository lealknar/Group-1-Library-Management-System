QA testing is critical for any library management system because it ensures that everything from catalog searches to borrowing and returning materials works reliably, securely, and as intended. It supports staff efficiency, and delivers a smooth experience for borrowers.

Each member of the group worked on different parts of the system, including the Frontend, Backend, Database, and QA.

                                            Mandocdoc Vince: Backend
                                            Grande Franz: Backend
                                            Sarasata Christian: Database
                                            Evangelista Karl: QA
                                            Delas Alas Mark Angelo: Frontend 


For the frontend we sent a POST request and validated the returned HTML using a script in the Tests tab. For the backend we used a POST request in Postman and wrote automated tests in the “Tests” (Post‑response) tab.
By building these automated Postman tests, I acted as the QA member who ensured that the group’s frontend, backend, and database work integrated correctly and performed within agreed limits.
